## UX

### Site Purpose:
The aim of ths site is to bring together people from various walks of life with pictures of wonderful locations around the world. [“Hidden Gems”](https://hidden-gem-blog-d08378ae9ea1.herokuapp.com/) is a blog with a variety of beautiful locations around the world which visitors to the site can look up and appreciate, some maybe even with the purpose of traveling to one of these based on the information provided.  Registered site users can sign up to a monthly newsletter with the latest locations posted.  They can also like posts and comment, giving them the possibility of interacting together based on their own experiences.

### Site Goal:
To create a community where various users can participate in sharing some of the most beautiful locations around the globe. We're also set on it being estalished as a top-quality comfort zone for travelers, whether traveling alone or as a family, so they can comfortably share and rely on experiences and tips given, such as the resources available.

### Audience:
Practically anybody with an interest in gorgeous landscapes since it makes for an excellent informative site on places to travel to and what to see.  Some may also be keen travelers who travel frequently.  Also, it's ideal for someone just seeking advice on what services to use abroad.

### Communication:
users are provided with user-friendly features to get in contact with site owner or other potential bloggers/users within the posts.

### Existing User Goals:
The capability of viewing, commenting on, and sharing experiences constantly within the community of travelers registered. Also, the potential to create collaborations to either facilitate a trip or support in other ways.

### New User Goals:
To feel welcomed by several posts on beautiful imagery and scenery to be discovered throughout the website.

### Future Goals:
- To provide users with a GPS location of the location and it's proximite surroundings that can be taken advantage of.
- Users and admin on the posts would be able to optionally provide specific recommendations in terms of hotel accomodations, or have the site provide default options based on the GPS location's proximity.
- The option for other bloggers to create their own posts to be approved and shared among the community as opposed to just the site admin's travels & posts.
- The ability to send out the monthly newsletter to subscribed user's emails with the newest experiences and possibly a contest with the chance to win a prize or souvenir.
- A structure within the website to help users plan their flights and have a rough estimate of a necessary budget, which could eventually lead to a flight-purchasing website such as skyscanner.

### Database Schema

### Colour Scheme:

![Colour Palette](static/images-readme/colour-scheme.png)

- #fff - is typically used as my background colour and also text colour in the case of there being a dark-coloured background.
- #212529 - is the text colour used throughout the webpage when there is a light-coloured background.
- #188181 - to resemble some familiarity with the blue colour within the logo, a different shade was actually used to help with the colour contrast issues.
- #F06814 - to resemble the orange colour within the logo and give a more familiar feeling throughout the webpage.
- #445261 - is used in the mastheads within the post details html pages to contrast the image colours.

### Typography:
All fonts were obtained from the Google Fonts library. I chose the following fonts for the page:
1. Poppins: used for titles and Navbar elements such as the nav-items and text-muted phrase.
2. Open Sans: Typically used for the body text of the webpage.

### Imagery:
- All images have been named in the credit section, most of which are photos of places, whereas the others related to travel are from free photo sites.

### BUG TESTING:
1. Heroku logs--tail error when deploying to Heroku:
 - Added correctly-written web: gunicorn gems.wsgi to ProcFile to link it correctly.

2. 'unexpected chunk number 1 (expected 0)' error:
 - This was caused be corrupted Data upon using loaddata with json.file according to Tutor Support.
 - Uncommented sqlite database and commented out external database to temporarily work on project before eventually providing a solution (mentioned in bug #3)

3. Opening new external Database:
 - Did pip install and pip freeze with all requirements, created env.py file, added new DB URL and secret key, collectstatic, updated CSRF, did makemigrations and migrate command and yet page would not load correctly.
 - The cloudinary URL was missing within the env.py, this allowed the page to load correctly.

4. CSS styles would not load:
 - Upon using terminal command to copy staticfiles into a template folder, accidently created and nested everything within an additional templates folder so url path did not connect.
 - Moved everything out to the correct template folder and css styles were loading correctly.

5. Admin interface content lacked RichText Editor for content fields in resources app:
 - summernote_fields was not correctly linked to content containers within the admin.py file.

6. Likes generated an error:
 - within the blog's models.py the model's related name for the like button clashed with the comment section, I changed the name so code could correctly distinguish model and this fixed the bug.

7. Validator error message <o:p>:
 - This was due to my population of the content fields having used my microsoft word to draft the tet before adding them to the admin interface, could not be seen in my code.
 - Manually accessed and edited code from Admin interface and deleted the tags.

8. Page would break when screen size was below 768px and only provide images:
 - Deleted 'flex: no-wrap' to fix this issue and correctly display text with the images so users can access post details for each post.

9. Editing a comment while awaiting approval:
 - Page would crash is user were to click on the edit button before comment had been approved.
 - Fixed the issue by removing the edit button for comments awaiting approval.

10. Navbar overflow:
 - Navbar displayed overflow off page between 1150px and 990px on all pages.
 - Reduced the logo size, nav-link size and text-muted size so elements would not cause navbar to overflow before collapsing as media response styles take effect.

11. Like button with a reverse path error:
 - Upon correcting some of the hyphens and underscores, the blog's urls.py path had the correct pattern, but the views.py file still had **'post-detail'** instead of **post_detail** within the reverse function call.

### Unfixed Bugs
1. Sign up form - HTML Validator errors:
- Upon validating, I noticed [4 errors with tags](static/images-readme/signup-html-errors.png) which were nowhere to be found within my code.
- With help from Tutor Support, we determined this was from Django's Allauth's error and that I could do nothing to fix it from my end.

## Deployment
The site was deployed to Heroku. The steps to deploy are as follows:
- Install Django & Gunicorn:
```pip3 install 'django<4' gunicorn```
- Install Django database & psycopg:
```pip3 install dj_database_url psycopg2```
- Install Cloudinary:
```pip3 install dj3-cloudinary-storage```
- Creating the requirements.txt file with the following command:
```pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt```
- a django project was created using:
```django-admin startproject printstatements .```
- the blog app was then created with:
```python3 manage.py startapp blog```
- which was then added to the settings.py file within our project directory.
- the changes were then migrated using:
```python3 manage.py migrate```
- navigated to [Heroku](www.heroku.com) & created a new app called print-statements.
- added the Heroku Postgres database to the Resources tab.
- navigated to the Settings Tab, to add the following key/value pairs to the configvars:
1. key: SECRET_KEY | value: randomkey
2. key: PORT | value: 8000
3. key: CLOUDINARY_URL | value: API environment variable
4. key: DATABASE_URL | value: value supplied by Heroku
- added the DATABASE_URL, SECRET_KEY & CLOUDINARY_URL to the env.py file
- added the DATABASE_URL, SECRET_KEY & CLOUDINARY_URL to the settings.py file
- add an import os statement for the env.py file.
- added Heroku to the ALLOWED_HOSTS in settings.py
- created the Procfile
- pushed the project to Github
- connected my github account to Heroku through the Deploy tab
- connected my github project repository, and then clicked on the "Deploy" button

* Due to Heroku revoking their frie tier access, the project has been redeployed using (Render)[https://render.com/] & (ElephantSQL)[https://www.elephantsql.com/] using the following [instructions](https://code-institute-students.github.io/deployment-docs/30-pp4/)
