### Existing User Goals:
The capability of viewing, commenting on, and sharing experiences constantly within the community of travelers registered. Also, the potential to create collaborations to either facilitate a trip or support in other ways.

### New User Goals:
To feel welcomed by several posts on beautiful imagery and scenery to be discovered throughout the website.

### Future Goals:
- To provide users with a GPS location of the location and it's proximite surroundings that can be taken advantage of.
- Users and admin on the posts would be able to optionally provide specific recommendations in terms of hotel accomodations, or have the site provide default options based on the GPS location's proximity.
- The option for other bloggers to create their own posts to be approved and shared among the community as opposed to just the site admin's travels & posts.
- The ability to send out the monthly newsletter to subscribed user's emails with the newest experiences and possibly a contest with the chance to win a prize or souvenir.
- A structure within the website to help users plan their flights and have a rough estimate of a necessary budget, which could eventually lead to a flight-purchasing website such as skyscanner.

### BUG TESTING:
1. index.html page not loading:
 - Through trial and error, I changed the view code from a class to a function.
 - as well as removed the ```.as_view()``` from the URL path.

2. CSS styles not loading on blog page:
 - This [Django tutorial](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.0/intro/tutorial06/) indicated that the styles were incorrectly linked.
 - This was resolved updating the href link in the base.html to ```{% static 'css/style.css' %}```

3. Error message after installing Allauth:
 - Tutor support informed me that Heroku had updated my database url value.
 - This was resolved by updating the env.py file with the new URL.

4. Invalid "syntax" error after installing **crispy-forms**:
 - A comma was missing from within the BlogPostPage class.

5. Django error message after adding comment form:
 - CSRF token had been added as CRSF.
 - Correcting the error resolved the issue.

6. Console error after adding "Categories" field to Artprints model:
 - The console indicated that a default field had not been supplied.
 - As I did not remember that it would need to be an integer, I added ```default='undecided'``` to the field.
 - This produced further error messages.
 - I corrected the model, and attempted to migrate the changes once more. The same error continued to display on the console.
 - I looked up how to revert the migrations on [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/32123477/how-to-revert-the-last-migration) using the following command: ```./manage.py migrate artprints zero```, but this did not resolve the issue.
 - After consulting with a fellow student who had experienced something similar, [Mats Simonsson](https://github.com/Pelikantapeten), I then deleted the files out of the migrations folder within my app folder.
 - This resolved this issue.
 - However upon contemplation, I have understood that had the database been significantly populated with data, this would not be a reasonable approach to take, as it would eliminate important information.

7. URL paths for second app:
 - Being unable to submit an empty string as the first parameter in the main URLs folder, my weblink was displaying as **prints/prints/**.
 - Having tried multiple suggestions from numerous sources, I instead resorted to changing the main URL path to **art** so that any new URL path created in the second app file, would then display as **art/pathname**
 - This is not the resolution that I was looking for, however for aesthetics, I have accepted it as the solution for now.

8. Hero & About image not loading on deployed site:
 - These two images were stored directly within the django app as opposed to being uploaded to Cloudinary.
 - I tried numerous articles that suggested to change the URL path linked in the CSS file, and tried the following:
  - ```background: url(/static/images/gallery-wall.jpg) no-repeat;``` : As shown in [Simpleit](https://simpleit.rocks/python/django/call-static-templatetag-for-background-image-in-css/)
  - ```background: url('{% static "/images/gallery-wall.jpg" %}') no-repeat;``` : As showing in [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5898776/how-to-refer-to-static-files-in-my-css-files)
  - ```background: url('{% static "images/gallery-wall.jpg" %}') no-repeat;```
  - ```background: url("{{ STATIC_URL }}images/gallery-wall.jpg") no-repeat;```
  - ```background: url(static("images/gallery-wall.jpg"));```
 - As none of these resolved the issue, and I was unable to ascertain the solution that I required, I instead resorted to loading the images directly into the HTML files as opposed to the CSS. 
 - Issue resolved.

9. Art submission form unable to complete:
 - Terminal error suggested no file was selected.
 - I read numerous articles on stackoverflow, cloudinary, comments on slack, and was unable to resolve this.
 - Ger from Tutor support indicated that the required field was missing from my form tags ```enctype="multipart/form-data```
 - Adding this resolved the issue.

10. User unable to submit multiple prints:
 - This was due to the slug field not being included in the form submission.
 - Another side effect of this, is that when the print was then approved via the admin panel, should the admin not pay attention and approve it without inserting a slug, the entire prints page would then fail to load.
 - To resolve this, the slug field was added to the form field.
 - Have not yet figured out how to have this auto-populate as it would were it submitted directly from the admin panel.
 - However, adding the slug field ensures that the "Create" feature of CRUD now works as intended.

11. Blog post page pushes social links to left:
 - Upon inspection in dev tools, the row containing the comments was being duplicated, causing the layout to shift.
 - Issue resolved by moving the ```{% endif %}``` inside of the closing div for the row.
 - This then caused an issue with the view when the user was logged out.
 - Once more, the opening & closing if statements needed to be moved outside the row entirely.

12. Submit multiple comments:
- Due to how the comments section was set up in the html file, upon submission of a comment, regardless of approval, the form would no longer be available to the user. Instead, a display message was constantly shown, suggesting that the comment was still pending approval, even if it had been approved.
- To resolve this, the section in the HTML was removed, and instead a line was added to the view function so that a success message would display on the screen after submission. This then allows the user to go and submit multiple comments on the same post, regardless of whether they have an approved or pending comment already submitted.

13. Testing CRUD functionality:
 - Each of the features were tested multiple times to ensure that numerous new posts could be submitted, and that each post had the ability to be updated and edited by the user that submitted it.
 - If a post is submitted by another user, the edit/delete buttons do not appear on the page.

14. Forms test failed to run:
 - When running the newly created test in forms.py, the following error occurred in the terminal: "Got an error creating the test database: permission denied to create database".
 - A [Slack comment](https://code-institute-room.slack.com/archives/C026PTF46F5/p1647428298841409?thread_ts=1647427231.501879&cid=C026PTF46F5) provided the answer for this, & suggested that the new DATABASES variable in the settings.py file needed to be commented out, and the original one to be made active again for the tests to work.
 - Following these steps allowed the test to perform as expected.

15. AssertionError: 301 != 200:
 - The second test implemented from the "Hello Django" project failed each time it was ran.
 - The answer on how to resolve it was ascertained from [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21215035/django-test-always-returning-301), and adding an ```follow=True``` to the code in turn caused the tests to pass.
